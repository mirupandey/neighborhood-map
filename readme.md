## Neighbourhood Map - Know Your Rawatbhata

This single page application shows a map of my city Rawatbhata. This app is built for a Neighbourhood map project which is a part of the Front End Web Development Nanodegree at Udacity.

## Libraries, frameworks and APIs used

1. Knockout JS
2. Google Maps
3. Foursquare
4. Fontawesome
5. JQuery

## Project Requirements

* Display map markers identifying at least 5 locations that you are interested in within chosen neighborhood. Your app displays those locations by default when the page is loaded.
* Implement a list view of the set of locations.
* Provide a filter option that uses an input field to filter both the list view and the map markers displayed by default on load. The list view and the markers update accordingly.
* Add functionality using third-party APIs to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked.
* Add functionality to animate a map marker when either the list item associated with it or the map marker itself is selected.
* Add functionality to open an infoWindow when either a location is selected from the list view or its map marker is selected directly.
* The app's interface is intuitive to use. For example, the input text area to filter locations is easy to locate. It should be easy to understand what set of locations is being filtered.
* Google maps and Forsquare errors are handled gracefully.
